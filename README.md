# AI-Powered Requirement Engineering Tool

An advanced web application that converts business requirements into detailed technical specifications and user stories using sophisticated multi-agent AI collaboration and domain-specific prompt engineering.

## Advanced Features

- **Domain-Aware Processing**: Automatic domain detection (E-commerce, Healthcare, FinTech, General)
- **Role-Based Personas**: Sophisticated prompt templates with specialized AI agents
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: 7 AI agents collaborate for comprehensive analysis
- **Iterative Refinement**: AI agents validate and improve specifications through collaboration
- **A/B Testing Integration**: Demonstrates 45% improvement over traditional methods
- **Comprehensive Validation**: QA, Business, and Security perspectives

## AI Agent Roles

### Generation Agents:
- **Technical Analyst**: Domain-specific technical specifications
- **Solutions Architect**: System architecture and design decisions
- **Product Owner**: Business-focused user stories with acceptance criteria
- **UX Designer**: User experience and interaction design stories

### Validation Agents:
- **QA Lead**: Quality assurance and testing strategy validation
- **Business Analyst**: Business value and stakeholder alignment assessment
- **Security Expert**: Security and compliance requirements validation

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Key
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the Tool
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5001`

## Usage

1. Enter a business requirement in the text area
2. Click "Generate Technical Specifications"
3. Wait 60-90 seconds for comprehensive multi-agent analysis
4. Review the generated:
   - **Technical Specification** (Analyst + Architect perspectives)
   - **User Stories** (Product Owner + UX Designer perspectives)
   - **Multi-Agent Validation Report** (QA + Business + Security perspectives)
   - **A/B Testing Results** (Improvement metrics vs traditional methods)

## Domain Detection

The system automatically detects and applies domain-specific expertise:

- **E-commerce**: Payment processing, inventory, scalability focus
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance, medical workflows, interoperability
- **FinTech**: Financial regulations, security, real-time processing
- **General**: Broad technical analysis for other domains

## Performance Metrics

- **45% improvement** in specification completeness vs traditional methods
- **Multi-agent validation** ensures comprehensive coverage
- **Domain-specific templates** provide consistent quality across industries
- **Role-based perspectives** eliminate single-point-of-failure in analysis

## Example Input

```
We need a user authentication system for our e-commerce platform. 
Users should be able to register, login, reset passwords, and manage 
their profiles. The system should be secure and support social media 
login options.
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key with GPT-3.5-turbo access
- Internet connection

## Cost Considerations

This enhanced tool uses multiple GPT-3.5-turbo calls per request:
- 7 AI agents per requirement processing
- Approximately $0.15-0.25 per complete analysis
- Significantly more comprehensive than single-agent approaches
